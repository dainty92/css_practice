            <p>My name is <b>Esther Olubunmi AJAYI.</b>
                During my secondary school education, I got keenly interested in how science is applied to solve everyday challenges/problems around us.
                My interest in analysis for decision-making purposes heightened with some courses I took at the University.
                So, the rave about <i>Big Data/Data Science/Analysis</i> reeling in Nigeria recently, more than ever, was just a perfect match, and also an appropriate time for me to venture into what I have always wanted to explore.
                I started my journey into Data Science when I enrolled on Abocoders Training Programme in January 2020.
                It is a collaboration programme with the Ogun State government to support young ladies/women towards realising their technology goals and also help in closing the wide gap between them and their male counterparts in technology.
                The training was concluded with a project defence session in September after weeks of classroom tutoring, practices, assignments, competitions, etc
                My passion for more tech, wanting to know algorithms and data structures, what different programming languages are doing behind the scenes, distributed systems, writing clean code, documentation, testing and source control which most data scientists don’t focus on.
                I believe being a <b>software engineer</b>/data scientist will be a valuable combination. This catalysis my learning process at <b>Stutern</b>.

            <p>The learning experience at <b>Stutern</b> has been enormously worthwhile with some other online resources harnessed.
                Amongst many things I’ve learnt, I’ll mention a few.
                I’ve learnt about HTML, which stands for <i>Hyper Text Markup Language,</i> and is one of the fundamental building blocks of the web.
                The styling of the web is defined by CSS, and much of the interactivity is controlled by JavaScript.
                CSS stands for <i>Cascading Style Sheets,</i> it's a way to describe style rules that we'd like to set for our HTML elements.
                CSS is very <b>important in web designing</b> because it makes the front end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience.
                Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate.
                In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font colour and more. CSS does a lot more than make your site look pretty.
                It offers various other benefits that can directly impact the user experience on the website.

            <h2>Third Section</h2>
            <p><b>Margin</b> is used to generate space around elements.
                The <b>padding</b> <i>property in CSS</i> defines the innermost portion of the box model, creating space around an element's content, inside of any defined margins and/or borders.
                The <b>border</b> <i>property</i> defines the space between an element's padding and margin.
